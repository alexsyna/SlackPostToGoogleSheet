# slack_post_to_sheets
Do you want to daily update your product's status in your director's google sheet? 
This is the solution to avoid opening every day the same damn google sheet link.
This slack add-on allows you to answer status questions in your slack channel and have them automatically printed in your director's notes.

It's more a custom solution rather than a product, but with some installation's conf it will save you a lot of time and frustration.
